# TAI-G7-Lab1

## Requirements

- CMake >= 3.10

## Building

In order to build the project, first create a `build` directory and generate a CMake native build environment.
If using Unix, run:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

After that, build the binaries, within the `build` directory:

```
cmake --build .
```

The generated binaries will be present in the `bin` folder.

## Usage

### `cpm`

To use the copy model, run:

```
./bin/cpm <k> <file>
```

...

### `cpm-gen`
